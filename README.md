Hookless is a [reactive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming) library for Java. It automatically updates dependent reactive values whenever change is detected in any of their dependencies, which can be reactive variables or other reactive values. The point of reactive programming is to avoid the many problems with traditional callbacks (managing subscriptions, event rates, memory leaks, ...).
