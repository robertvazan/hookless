Hookless is a [reactive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming) library for Java.
It automatically runs dependent reactive computations whenever change is detected in any of their dependencies.
It is nearly completely transparent to application code, because it tracks dependencies implicitly via thread-local context object.
