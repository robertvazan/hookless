/*
 * Reactive trigger is a low-level reactive primitive that is usually hidden inside higher-level reactive constructs.
 * It is the only way to get change notifications from reactive variables, but it is easy to set it up
 * to monitor single variable. Custom callbacks for variable changes thus aren't lost.
 * It is also used to create callbacks for all high-level reactive constructs, which can be done
 * by reading their state inside reactive scope and arming a trigger with variables collected by the scope.
 * This is why no other reactive construct offers any callbacks.
 * 
 * Trigger has many advantages over plain callbacks:
 * - monitoring multiple variables
 * - protection from race rules between version read and subscription to changes
 * - protection from accidental garbage collection due to weak references in variables
 * - choice between callback and state polling (armed(), fired(), closed())
 * - explicit forced firing even if no variable changes
 * 
 * The standard sequence of calls is: arm(), fire(), close().
 * Some calls can be skipped and the trigger will still behave reasonably.
 * Methods fire() and close() may be called repeatedly.
 * 
 * Trigger implements AutoCloseable, so that it can be used in try-with-resources,
 * although that's usually only useful in unit tests.
